Intro

In an era where information is always available, staying informed about the latest political developments has become crucial. But what if you could wake up each morning to a curated email containing the freshest political news?

This project is your ticket to an exciting journey that brings you the freshest news right to your inbox every day at 5am. Buckle up as you navigate through client requirements!

Client Requirements

Imagine waking up to a curated selection of the freshest top 10 political news articles from meneame.net every single day. 

To keep things spicy, yesterday's news can't creep into today's spotlight! 

To make it even more awesome, emails that you receive aren't just boring text - each news title is a gateway to a wild adventure! Clickable headers invite you to dive headfirst into the original articles, leaving mediocrity behind.

Mastering The Code

Here are the amazing technologies that helped me bring this project to life! The heart of this project beats with the power of Python Libraries, such as:
os
dotenv
smtplib
requests
BeautifulSoup
MIMEText/MIMEMultipart

To top this I explored the capabilities of cron to ensure timely delivery of freshest news right to the inbox. 

And as if that wasn't enough, I mastered scheduling it on the AWS EC2 Instance to make sure news is delivered even when my computer is not too active.
